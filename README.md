# Comprehensive Statistical Tests

I have compiled a comprehensive collection of statistical tests to facilitate easy reference as needed. The repository includes two notebooks:

### statistic_analysis_1.ipynb (ru)
1. **Confidence Intervals**
2. **Hypothesis Testing**
3. **Parametric Tests**
4. **Non-parametric Tests**

### statistic_analysis_2.ipynb (ru)
1. **Correlations**
2. **Multiple Hypothesis Testing**
3. **Regression Analysis**

### Notes:
1. All tests are conducted on synthetic data.
2. All comments are in Russian.
